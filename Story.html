		<p>My whole life I have had a speech impediment where my R s sound funny, but it was not until middle school when I started getting bullied about it. My best friend name was Sarah and mean girls would make fun of the way I said her name. Fast forward to now, we all are seniors in high school. To this day my friends will still poke fun at my speech, and they do not know how badly it hurts.

Ashley, 18
I was fresh off of moving to a new town and entering my freshman year in a high school where I knew nobody. Nobody likes fresh meat, especially girls. That first week I introduced myself in every class so, people would at least know my name which severely backfired during gym. A guy started talking to me and the whole time, these two girls were whispering to each other while looking directly at me. 
I later found out that the boy was dating one of the girls. The girls spread rumors that I was a slut and I was hearing how I hooked up with all these boys after the first week. Mind you, I had never met any of the guys I had apparently hooked up with.
 So I had to pretty much start from negative scratch to build a reputation I actually liked for myself while everyone else was calling me a slut for unknowingly talking to someone else boyfriend." 
</p>
I cannot remember a time when I was not bullied. I believe it started from my school life, kids would pull me across the playground by my bag and chase me around before school started and tried to bully me because i was not good in my studies and embarrass me. It got worse as the years went on. I remember 3rd grade. A group of kids who thought I was too quiet took out my class test papers at basketball court and said that I am abnormal, I am mental retarded and i can't study well. 
Even my teachers thought the same since nobody liked me in school I  had none to stand for me. 
They choked me and punched my stomach.  Since i was slow in everything my school said that they can't keep me anymore and that i should be in special school rather than the normal one. I changed my school but i didn't knew that i will be bullied even here. I was depressed and scared all the time. High school is where things hit the hardest. It was freshman year, I was a bigger girl ( very overweight ). 
I was bullied about my weight and my looks. I think it wasn't the bullying that made me feel so bad it was what was going on inside my head that made things hard. I could not function at all, I was so out of it. I needed help. I began to do self harm. NO boys wanted to go out me just because i was FAT since all my friends- i mean my classmates had boyfriend and girlfriend; I was lost, And every-time i reached out for help it always backfired and i was just a bunch of drama to my family and my school. After so much of bullies I started to laugh when kids called me by names and everyone who used to bully me thought that i was going crazy and left me alone. Now here i am, I am feeling a lot better. But whatever happens just know that your problems DO NOT define who you are. You are more than your depression and pain. You are strong. Now i am dating a hot guy who thinks that me being chubby with my natural beauty is the most beautiful thing in the world. Just wanna say that be you; you don't have to change for 
nobody. Love yourself and that what's will make ever pain go away. ----NIVA
